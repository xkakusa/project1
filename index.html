		<h1>Section 1: Basic of the web</h1>
			<h2 id="section1-1">The web</h2>
				<p>
					The web is like a bunch of computers talking to each other. Clicking on a link sends http request <br/> to a server and retrieves HTML  file and sends it to your web browser to display the page 
				</p>
			<h2 id="section1-2">HTML and Tags</h2>
				<p>
					HTML stands for hyper text markup language and is what forms the majority of content on the web.
				</p>
				<p>
					HTML files are made using elements. HTML tells the browser the type of element by using HTML tags 
				</p>
				<p>Some of the tags are</p>
					<ul>
						<li>"p" for paragraphs</li>
						<li>"b" for making words bold</li>
						<li>"em" for emphasizing words</li>
						<li>"img" for using images</li>
						<li>"a" for putting links in your page</li>
					</ul>
								
			<h2 id="section1-3">Inline and block</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Inline elements</b> such as span and "a". They are normaly displayed without line breaks. <br> <b>Block elements</b> such as "p" and "div" start and end with a new line, they also create and invisible box around the content.
				</p>
			<h2 id="section1-4">The way Computers work</h2>
